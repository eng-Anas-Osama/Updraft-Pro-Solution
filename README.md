AI-Powered Solution for Managing Website Backups on Google Drive

Overview

When managing multiple websites with the same Google Drive account, backups can become disorganized. By default, all backups are stored in the same folder, leading to clutter and difficulty in managing older backups. This solution, powered by AI, addresses two key issues:

Organized Backups: Automatically create a unique folder for each website's backups based on the site's name.

Automated Cleanup: Automatically remove older backups from Google Drive, ensuring efficient storage management.

The Problem

When backing up more than one website using the same Google Drive account:

All backups are stored in a single folder, causing disorganization.

Old backups must be removed manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

The Solution

This repository provides two code snippets that:

Create a unique folder for each website in Google Drive and organize backups by type (e.g., database or files).

Automatically delete older backups after a new backup is uploaded, keeping only the latest backups.

How It Works

Code Snippet 1: Organizing Backups by Website

This snippet ensures that backups for each website are stored in a dedicated folder named after the website. The folder structure includes subfolders for different backup types (e.g., database, files).

Code Snippet 2: Automated Cleanup of Old Backups

This snippet hooks into the backup process to remove older backups from Google Drive, retaining only the latest backups. The number of retained backups can be customized.

Benefits

Improved Organization: Backups are neatly stored in separate folders per website.

Automated Maintenance: Old backups are deleted automatically, saving time and avoiding manual intervention.

Scalability: Easily manage backups for multiple websites with minimal effort.

Setup Instructions

Add the provided code snippets to your WordPress theme's functions.php file or a custom plugin.

Ensure your UpdraftPlus plugin is connected to your Google Drive account.

Test the solution to confirm that backups are correctly organized and old backups are removed as expected.

Customization

Folder Naming: Modify the folder naming convention in the code if needed.

Retention Policy: Adjust the number of retained backups to suit your needs.
